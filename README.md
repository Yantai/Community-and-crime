# Community-and-crime
I did the research about the demographics and the crime rate by R. I tried to find the relationship between the different variables which represent different attribution of community and the crime rate. I used cluster algorithm to treat the missing values and applied many different algorithms to do regression. Finally I found the lasso had the best performance which means that it has minium test error. You can find the dataset from link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing
